# JS-Coding-Challenge-2

Create a function that filters out negative numbers
In this challenge, you’ll have a function that takes an array as input and returns an array. But if all goes according to plan, it’ll remove the negative numbers. This is another example of a task that’ll be useful when combing through data and looking for clever ways to eliminate “bad data.”
